# No Login Required! 🎉

**Good news:** Authentication has been removed from this application. You don't need any email or password to use it!

## How to Use

1. **Just start the app:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open your browser:**
   Go to: http://localhost:3000

3. **That's it!** You're in! No login required.

## Optional: Set Up Default Data

If you want to set up default users in the database (for data relationships), you can run:

```bash
npm run setup
```

This creates:
- A default therapist (for linking clients/assignments)
- A default admin (for admin features)

**But you still don't need to log in!** These are just for database relationships.

## What Changed?

- ✅ No login page required
- ✅ No authentication checks
- ✅ All features accessible immediately
- ✅ All data visible to everyone

## Start Using Now

Just run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Then visit: **http://localhost:3000**

No credentials needed! 🚀
